Usage limit indicators for current subscription tier
Results Dashboard:

Authenticity percentage display (0-100% scale: 0% = AI-generated, 100% = human-written)
Confidence level indicator with color coding (High: >80% green, Medium: 50-80% yellow, Low: <50% red)
Animated progress bar or circular gauge for authenticity score visualization
Detailed breakdown of analysis factors with Pro plan exclusive insights
History Management:

Search and filter functionality for historical analyses
Individual delete and bulk clear options
Export functionality (Pro plan feature)
User Experience:

Loading spinners and progress indicators during analysis
Toast notifications for success/error states
Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
Accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
Usage limit warnings and upgrade prompts
Technical Stack:

React 18+ with functional components and hooks
React Router for multi-page navigation
Context API or Redux for state management
Modern CSS with CSS modules or styled-components
Axios for API communication with proper error handling
Google OAuth library (@google-oauth/react)
Stripe React components (@stripe/react-stripe-js)
Backend Requirements (Python REST API):

POST /api/auth/google - Verify Google OAuth token and create/login user
POST /api/auth/refresh - Refresh JWT access token
POST /api/auth/logout - Invalidate user session
GET /api/auth/profile - Get user profile and subscription info
Subscription Endpoints:

GET /api/pricing/plans - Retrieve available pricing plans
POST /api/subscriptions/create - Create Stripe checkout session
GET /api/subscriptions/status - Get current subscription status
POST /api/subscriptions/cancel - Cancel subscription
POST /api/webhooks/stripe - Handle Stripe webhook events
GET /api/usage/current - Get current month usage statistics
Analysis Endpoints:

POST /api/analyze - Accept text content, return authenticity analysis (with usage tracking)
POST /api/upload - Handle file uploads, extract text, and process analysis
GET /api/history?page=1&limit=10 - Retrieve paginated analysis history
DELETE /api/history/{id} - Remove specific history entry
DELETE /api/history - Clear all history (with confirmation)
GET /api/health - Health check endpoint
Core Functionality:

User authentication and authorization middleware
Subscription tier validation and usage limit enforcement
Implement AI detection using one of these approaches:
Integration with existing APIs (OpenAI's AI classifier, Originality.ai, etc.)
Custom machine learning model using transformers library
Hybrid approach combining multiple detection methods
Robust file processing with python-docx for .docx and standard file handling for .txt
Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
Rate limiting based on subscription tier
Detailed logging and error tracking
Stripe webhook signature verification
Technical Stack:

FastAPI framework with async support
SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL database (production) / SQLite (development)
Pydantic for data validation
python-docx for document processing
PyJWT for token management
Stripe Python SDK
Google OAuth verification library
CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
